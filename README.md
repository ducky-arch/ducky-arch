Hey, so basically i am very interesting in coding and i started learning cpp at the (very)basic level and i'd like to read source code, contribute to repositories.
I like Android and AOSP very much so if you have something to say to me about that, feel free to do it.
My instagram is @duckywasfrickingtaken, message me there.
Bye!
